# Introduction

This repository contains code that I am practicing while following [Neural Network Zero-to-Hero](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) YouTube video series by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy).

Although I am working on Jupyter Notebook, I am using jupytext for easier version control. If you want to get this setup in your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Make virtual python environment `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Start notebook server `jupyter notebook`

`jupytext` should now convert all the python files to notebook files and sync any changes you make in either .ipynb or .py files.
